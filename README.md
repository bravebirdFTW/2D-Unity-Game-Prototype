# 2D Unity Game Prototype 🎮

A lightweight 2D prototype built in **Unity (C#)** to explore gameplay systems, dialogue flow, and combat logic inspired by *Undertale*.  
Developed as part of a personal learning initiative to strengthen skills in **gameplay programming**, **state machines**, and **event-driven architecture**.

---

## 🕹️ Overview
This project focuses on building gameplay logic from the ground up, rather than relying on Unity prefabs or built-in controllers.  
Every system was written manually to better understand how real gameplay programmers design low-level behaviors.

### Core Features
- **Custom player controller** using physics-based movement and manual collision handling  
- **Dialogue system** powered by coroutines and event sequencing  
- **Turn-based combat framework** with state transitions for Attack, Defend, and Idle modes  
- **Scene management and data persistence** to simulate level transitions  
- **Camera and animation control** for dynamic feedback

## 🧭 Learning Intent
This project was created to:
- Build comfort with gameplay loops and event systems similar to Unreal Engine’s architecture  
- Practice debugging and optimizing game logic  
- Experiment with player feedback systems, input timing, and modular code organization  

---

## 🧠 Next Steps
Future improvements may include:
- Expanding the combat system with enemy AI behaviors  
- Adding dialogue branching logic and choice-driven outcomes  
- Porting select systems into C++ for Unreal gameplay practice

### 💡 Summary
This project represents the bridge between **creative experimentation** and **engineering precision** — designed to strengthen my understanding of how gameplay systems are structured, debugged, and optimized at the code level.
